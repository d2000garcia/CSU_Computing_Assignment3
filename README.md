# CSU_Computing_Assignment3
Contains Diego Garcias response to problems in assignment 3

Hey Sam so I was not able to complete this weeks assignments completely due to time constraints. But I did work on every problem and can say I have a good grasp of the pointers and refernces but I still need to finish understanding functions and how to use structs. 
Thanks,
Diego
